"""Fixes regen.sh applies to the generated code after a regeneration (python3 tools/patch_gen.py src/recomp/gen).

Four functions start with a conditional jump on the flags of their CALLER's compare (the caller does `cmp` or
`test`, then jumps into them). The lifter gives each function a fresh `_flags = 0`, so the branch was never taken:
the Whomping Willow's right hand ended its solo strike on its first frame, and three other checks were skipped.
Until the toolkit's lifter learns this, each entry test is rewritten here to the caller's compare. Every fix finds
its line by exact text inside its own function and fails loudly if the line is gone (a lifter change), so a regen
never drops one silently. Running it twice changes nothing.
