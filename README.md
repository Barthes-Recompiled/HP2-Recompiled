# Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets NTSC-U — Xbox PC port

A native Windows port of the original Xbox game *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets* (2002), made by
**static recompilation**: the game's x86 code is translated to C and compiled for Windows, with the Xbox kernel,
Direct3D 8, DirectSound and input replaced by native code. No emulator.

Features beyond the original:
- **Picture:** resolutions up to 4K with MSAA/SMAA and anisotropic filtering, and true 16:9 (widened 3D, with 2D
  and cutscene shots kept in shape).
- **Display:** windowed, borderless or fullscreen.
- **Sound:** 5.1 surround output.
- **Controls:** keyboard and mouse with rebinding and a movement pace on the mouse wheel; controller remapping,
  deadzones and vibration strength.
- **Accessibility:** colour-blind correction filters.
- **Smooth play:** shaders prepared ahead.

**This repository contains no game content.** To play or build it you need the files from your own copy of the
Xbox disc. The build regenerates the recompiled code from your `default.xbe`.

## Which disc

**Only the North American (NTSC-U) release works.** Its `default.xbe` has region 1 (North America) and a build
date of 17 October 2002 in its certificate. The European/PAL release (region 4, built 18 October 2002) contains
the same game, but its code sits at different addresses, so this build can't run it. A PAL build may come later.

## Playing

Download the latest release, put your NTSC-U disc's files or the .xiso in a `game` folder beside the executables and
start `hpcos_launcher.exe`. Requirements, controls and every option are in [port/README.txt](port/README.txt);
what changed in each release is in [port/CHANGES.md](port/CHANGES.md).

## Building

See [port/DEVELOPING.md](port/DEVELOPING.md): setup, regenerating the code from the XBE, building and making a
release.
